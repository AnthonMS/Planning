# Planning
37-hours Assignment

This is just the repository where you can see my planning game for our 37-Hour assignment. 
The assignment was to create a Wordpress website or a Drupal website, and then write a Plugin or Module. 

I made mine in Wordpress and I made a Plugin that was able to use a Custom Post Type, and make posts with it. 
These posts are then shown in the one of the Pages, where the newest will be highest.

The site was about the game we are making in Game Dev. and the Custom Posts type, was so you could easily post Updates about how it was going and what we still needed.

The site is nÃ³n Google Cloud, but I have not got a domain to it yet. But here is the IP. -> http://35.230.134.132/
